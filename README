This section of Rosalind is dedicated to learning the algorithms used in bioninformatics and why they're important/what they're used for.

Most of these problems can be solved in a naive/brute force way or using a more sophisticated strategy.
Because many datasets used in bioinformatics are so large it's often crucial to solve these problems in 
lower average/worst case time as the asymptotic time in asymptotic complexity will actually be approached
