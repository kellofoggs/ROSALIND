Assumptions:
     each member of the populatoin mates within its generation
     Next Generation is from the prior generation where N individuals are born
     
Assume we're studying a diploid 

given N m g k
N = number of diploid individuals initially
m = copies of dominant allele
g = After how many generations we'll expect k  or more recessive allele copies
k = equal or more expected allele copies at the gth generation
